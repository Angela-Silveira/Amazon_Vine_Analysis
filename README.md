Reviews were further organized to compare Vine program reviews versus unpaid user reviews of products - specifically 5-star reviews. 

## Results
- In total, the kitchen items included 1,207 paid/Vine reviews and 97,839 unpaid/non-Vine reviews.
- Of the Vine reviews, 509 were 5-star ratings. Of the non-Vine reviews, 45,858 were 5-star ratings. 
- 42% of Vine reviews were 5-stars while 47% of non-Vine reviews were 5-stars.

## Summary
Based on the percentage of 5-star reviews, non-Vine users provide a greater percentage 5-star ratings than Vine users - so there is no positivity bias in the Vine program. 
Additional analysis could include a distribution of star ratings for products with largest number of reviews - one distribution for Vine users and one for non-Vine users.
